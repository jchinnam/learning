# Regression vs. Classification

Regression model: predicts continuous values, ie:
  What is the value of a house in California?
  What is the probability that a user will click on this ad?

Classification model: predicts discrete values, ie:
  Is a given email message spam or not spam?
  Is this an image of a dog, a cat, or a hamster?
